Social Media CLI

## Overview

## Course of feature development
This is quite a gradual project, but will be worked on in the following increments.

* Gmail read-only email 
  * Get Recent email snippets
  * Get snippet list of emails with any query
  * Get full email from previous list

* Basic Gmail cleanup and niceties
  * Improve UX for web login
  * Better templating

* Add a CLI homescreen to add other services




### Future Services
The following is a list of services (in order) that I will integrate:
  * Gmail
  * Google Calendar
  * Facebook Messenger
  * Facebook
  * Linkedin Notifications

NOTE: I don't have, hence won't probably add, Twitter, Instagram or Snapchat.
